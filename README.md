## Background
This is the front-end user interface for the [Northcoders News API](https://github.com/dweverson/nc_news_heroku) I previously made. It is my second solo project for the Northcoders coding bootcamp. Users can view, sort and upvote articles as well as adding and deleting comments. It is built using vanilla CSS for styling and also imports a Bootstrap dropdown menu.
